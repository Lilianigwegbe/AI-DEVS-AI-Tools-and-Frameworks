## Comparison: Scikit-learn vs. TensorFlow

| Criteria                     | Scikit-learn                                   | TensorFlow                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Target Applications**     | Designed for **classical machine learning** tasks such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, and model evaluation. | Built for **deep learning** and complex neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers for tasks in vision, NLP, time series, etc. |
| **Ease of Use for Beginners** | Very beginner-friendly with a consistent and simple API (`fit()`, `predict()`, etc.). Excellent for learning core ML concepts. | Steeper learning curve, especially with low-level APIs. Keras (TFâ€™s high-level API) improves usability for beginners. |
| **Community Support**       | Mature and stable with strong support from academia and developers. Rich documentation and examples. | Large, active global community. Backed by Google. Continuous updates, strong support in production and deployment. |

### Summary:

- Choose **Scikit-learn** for starting with machine learning, educational use, or small-scale prototyping of standard models.
- Choose **TensorFlow** when working on deep learning projects that require flexibility, scalability, and deployment support.
