# AI Tools and Frameworks

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the **Week 3 AI Tools and Frameworks Assignment**. The project explores real-world applications of widely-used AI frameworks such as **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **spaCy** through theoretical analysis, hands-on coding, and ethical considerations.

## Tools & Frameworks Used

- **Scikit-learn** – For classical machine learning models
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – For deep learning (CNN on MNIST)
- **spaCy** – For NLP tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – For development and testing
- **Markdown & PDF** – For documentation and reporting
- **Streamlit (Bonus)** – Optional model deployment interface

## Project Tasks Summary

### 1. Theoretical Understanding
- Explained key differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Described Jupyter Notebook applications in AI development
- Compared spaCy with basic Python string methods for NLP
- Conducted comparative analysis of Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

### 2. Practical Implementation
- **Task 1:** Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn (Iris dataset)
- **Task 2:** CNN model using TensorFlow for MNIST classification
- **Task 3:** spaCy-based NER and sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews

### 3. Ethics & Optimization
- Identified bias in datasets/models
- Reviewed fairness tools (TensorFlow Fairness Indicators, spaCy rules)
- Debugged a faulty TensorFlow training script

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository or open notebooks directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn tensorflow spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Run the notebooks step-by-step and examine visual outputs, metrics, and code behavior.
